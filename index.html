<h1 class="h1">WORKOUT TIPS & ADVICE</h1>
<div class="bi2">
    <h1>1. What is the best routine for the gym?</h1>
    <p>The best routine for the gym is one that is flexible with your schedule and you actually enjoy. These two factors will contribute greatly to your ability to be consistent with your workouts. Consistency with your workouts and progressing as you perform them is what will lead to results.</p>
    <p>That being said, there are plenty of great workout program styles one can do to build muscle, lose fat, or build strength. The body composition goals (building muscle and losing fat) will be accomplished through similar style workouts combined with differing nutritional principles, while those looking for strength gains may need to focus on programs that are centered on the idea of specificity.</p>
    <p>To sum that statement up, if you want to change your body composition, you’ll want to train with volume. If you want to build strength, you’ll want a program that is strength specific for the lifts you want to improve such as the bench press, squat and deadlift.</p>
</div>
<div class="bi2">
    <h1>2. What body parts to work on what days?</h1>
    <p>The answer to this question would assume that the person asking is referring to body part splits. In this case, the way you split your days likely won’t matter too much, as long as you work every body part throughout the week.</p>
    <p>There may be some benefit into ensuring you don’t hit chest and shoulders or legs and back on consecutive days, but if you do, it probably won’t be that big of an issue depending on your overall strength levels.</p>
    <p>However, if you are looking to optimize your training by incorporating a higher training frequency (hitting each muscle group more often throughout the week), you may want to look into pairing certain muscle groups on certain workout days.</p>
    <p>The most popular pairings are full body workouts, upper/lower workouts, push/pull workouts and push/pull/legs workouts.</p>
    <p>Again, the actual days you put your workouts on likely won’t make that much of a difference to the overall outcome of your training so long as you are consistent with your workouts and implement progressive overload (increasing the weight used) over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="bi2">
    <h1>3. How do I schedule my workout at the gym?<h1>
    <p>This all boils down to setting up and selecting workout programs that are both flexible and enjoyable. There is no perfect one way to set up training. It’s very subjective from person to person</p>
    <p>If you only have 2 days where you’re able to make it to the gym, a full body workout makes sense. 3 days? Full body makes sense, push/pull/legs can work as well if that is what you enjoy. The more days you have available, the more split and scheduling options you’ll have.</p>
    <p>Start off by figuring out how many and what days you can make it to the gym regularly. Then, look to schedule your training on those days. Find a workout that doesn’t require any more than that total training frequency. Then, look for something where if you miss a training day, you’re able to make it up throughout the week or already train that muscle more than once per week.</p>
</div>

<div class="bi2">
    <h1>4. What is a good gym routine?<h1>
    <p>A good gym routine is one that you enjoy, works your muscles with the appropriate frequency and volume for your experience level, and that you can be consistent with.</p>
    <p>This can look very different from person to person.</p>
    <p>Exercise selection for a good gym routine will train fundamental movement patterns (push, pull, lunge, hip hinge, squat, and carry) in a way that you are comfortable performing them. There is a pain-free variation for nearly every body type who can healthily perform these movements.<p></p>
    <p>A good gym routine also focuses on progression. This means making the workouts more challenging in some way from week to week, or training phase to training phase as you get more advanced.</p>
