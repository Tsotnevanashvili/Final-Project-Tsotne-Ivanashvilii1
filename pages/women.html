        <h1>Workout Description</h1>
        <p>Outlined below are 4 full body workouts perfect for women looking to build lean muscle, lose fat, and increase strength.</p>
        <p>As written, the program can be performed in an every other day fashion where you rotate the workouts each day you go to the gym.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, you can perform the workouts on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday (or in a 2 days on/1 day off fashion).</p>
        <p>Each workout is broken up into a primary workout. These are the exercises that are necessary to perform on that training day. For your rest periods, youâ€™ll want to rest anywhere between 45-90 seconds. For larger lifts, such as squats, you may want to take the full 90 seconds.</p>
        <p>After the primary workout on each day is an additional optional workout you can perform immediately after your primary full body workout. These additional workouts isolate the glutes, core, and arms. For your rest periods with these exercises, limit them to 30 seconds.</p>
        <p>The reason for the two glute isolation workouts is due to the common goal among women to grow their glutes. This is best achieved through training the glutes at least 4 times per week, with two of the glute workouts being isolated-focus with higher repetitions.</p>
        <p>Any of these additional bonus workouts can be altered in any way that best fits your own individual goals.</p>
