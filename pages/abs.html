    <div class="text2">
        <h1>Workout Description</h1>
        <p>As with every other muscle in the body, the abs need to be trained regularly if you want to improve the way they look and perform. Unfortunately, abs aren’t normally given the same attention and focus as other body parts. You ever notice how most splits don’t include them? This is because most lifters “throw them in” after another body part at random. If you want the abs to look good and be strong, then it takes the same effort and focus as the other muscle groups.</p>
        <p>The abs, or core, is crucial in overall physique development. For physique purposes, they are the centerpiece of the body. The standards of being lean are measured by the way your abs look.</p>
        <p>As for performance, the core must be strong if you want to fulfill your potential. Let’s look at the squat as an example. Yes, squats are for the legs, but if your abs aren’t strong enough to maintain stability, then you won’t be able to control how you move the weight.</p>
        <h1>How Often Should You Train Abs</h1>
        <p>Now that we’ve agreed that ab training needs to be taken more seriously, how much more seriously should it be taken? Devoting two sessions a week to them with at least 72 hours in between is very beneficial. You can place these workouts wherever you want in your training split, but make sure you start the workouts with your ab training. Committing yourself to the abs at the beginning when you’re fresh and focused can be the key to yielding the greatest results.</p>
        <h1>Abs Are Made in the Kitchen</h1>
        <p>The way you eat has a direct correlation to how your abs look. So let’s talk about how you eat before we get to work. If your abs aren’t visible, then you need to focus on eating healthy. There are plenty of articles here on M&S that can help you determine the proper amount of macronutrients you should eat.</p>
        <p>Another valuable tool that you can benefit from is the Basal Metabolic Rate Daily Calorie Calculator. This tool can help you determine how many calories you need based on the effort you give to the training. When you start creating your nutrition plan or using any of those that we offer, bookmark the BMR calculator so you have access to it anytime you need it.</p>
        <h1>Ab Training at Home</h1>
        <p>There are many people that have committed to working out at home, and they deserve to see results just like those of us that go to the gym. So, this program allows you to perform the exercises anywhere you have available space. The only equipment that you should need is a light weighted ball or dumbbells and ankle weights. If you don’t have those items, then your bodyweight alone would be fine.</p>
        <p>There will be two workouts included. One is a straight-set, normal session that shouldn’t take you more than 20 minutes. The other is the same exercises but performed in a circuit fashion that will take you around 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>The first workout allows you to focus on the quality of the muscle contraction with each rep. The second one is a speed session to really challenge the muscles.</p>
